### 🏛️ 0x01: EXECUTIVE ACADEMIC SUMMARY
I am a specialized Researcher and Developer at **Christ University**, operating at the intersection of **Advanced Cybersecurity**, **Predictive Data Science**, and **High-Performance Full-Stack Engineering**. With a consistent academic standing of a **9.55 GPA**, my professional focus is the implementation of type-safe, resilient architectures that mitigate modern attack vectors while maximizing computational efficiency.

My work follows the "Defense in Depth" philosophy, ensuring that security is not an add-on, but an intrinsic property of the application lifecycle—from initial data modeling to frontend state management.

### 🚀 0x02: DEEP-DIVE PROJECT ARCHITECTURES

#### 🥊 PROJECT ALPHA: [PunchIn Tracker](https://punchin-tracker.pages.dev)
**Domain:** Enterprise Resource Management & Operational Analytics
**Stack:** `Next.js 14`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Prisma`, `PostgreSQL`

- **Architectural Philosophy**: Designed as a high-concurrency multi-tenant platform for synchronized attendance and performance tracking.
- **Technical Implementation Details**:
    - **Frontend State Management**: Leveraged React Context and custom hooks for optimistic UI updates, ensuring a sub-100ms perceived latency during high-frequency data entry.
    - **Server-Side Optimization**: Utilized Next.js Server Components (RSC) to minimize client-side JavaScript bundles, resulting in a Lighthouse performance score of 98+.
    - **Database Schema**: Engineered a relational PostgreSQL schema with complex indexing and views to generate real-time performance metrics across thousands of concurrent sessions.
- **Security Posture**:
    - Implemented CSRF protection and Secure Cookie handling for session management.
    - Standardized data sanitization using Zod for schema validation, preventing injection attacks at the edge.
- **Data Analytics**:
    - Integrated custom aggregation logic to transform raw timestamp data into actionable productivity heatmaps.

#### 🌌 PROJECT BETA: [Axovanth](https://axovanth.pages.dev)
**Domain:** Enterprise Operating System & Real-Time Governance
**Stack:** `Next.js 15`, `Convex (Real-time FaaS)`, `TypeScript`, `Clerk`, `Lucide React`

- **Architectural Philosophy**: A hyper-optimized Enterprise Control Plane replacing disjointed SaaS tools with a unified, event-driven command center utilizing reactive database streams.
- **Technical Implementation Details**:
    - **Real-Time Synchronization Protocol**: Replaced traditional REST polling with Convex's WebSocket-based subscription model, achieving sub-millisecond state propagation across distributed client nodes.
    - **Edge Runtime Enforcement**: Configured API routes to execute on the Edge, minimizing cold starts and ensuring low-latency global access for critical workspace operations.
    - **High-Density UI Construction**: Designed a "God-Mode" interface using Glassmorphism principles and Tailwind CSS, optimizing information density for complex administrative workflows.
- **Security Posture**:
    - **Granular RBAC Kernel**: Engineered a custom Identity Matrix merging Clerk authentication with internal logic to handle complex, multi-tenant permission scopes (Organization level vs. Workspace level).
    - **Logical Isolation**: Implemented strict permission boundaries between "Departmental Nodes," ensuring data from Engineering cannot bleed into Legal or HR environments.
    - **Immutable Audit Logging**: Integrated a write-only ledger system that tracks state mutations (transfers, deletions, role changes) for compliance and forensic analysis.

#### 🚀 PROJECT GAMMA: [ThreatStream](https://threatstream.pages.dev)
**Domain:** Network Security Intelligence & Traffic Analysis
**Stack:** `Python`, `Scapy`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Kali Linux`

- **Architectural Philosophy**: An advanced network defense engine focused on packet-level analysis and predictive threat identification.
- **Technical Implementation Details**:
    - **Traffic Sniffing Engine**: Engineered custom Scapy scripts for raw packet capture and filtering, targeting specific protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP) for diagnostic reporting.
    - **Data Lifecycle**: Raw PCAP data is cleaned and vectorized using NumPy before being processed by Pandas for high-speed statistical analysis.
    - **Visual Intelligence**: Automated the generation of network topology and threat-distribution graphs using Matplotlib for security operations center (SOC) visualization.
- **Security Hardening & Pentesting**:
    - Applied Google Cybersecurity Professional standards to perform vulnerability assessments on local network environments.
    - Executed signature-based detection for common attack vectors, including SYN floods and ARP poisoning.
- **ML Potential**:
    - Structured the data pipeline to support future Scikit-learn integration for anomaly-based (unsupervised) threat detection.
